A simple java Open AI application works as chat GPT prompt

API keys for Chat GPT are governed by the Chat GPT license. You can create an OpenAI account and obtain a free key to try out the service. 
However, be aware that this key will expire three months after its creation, and usage limits apply, which may lead to encountering errors. 
For further details, refer to this thread: https://community.openai.com/t/openai-api-keys-in-free-account/348972.

Once you have your OpenAI key, you can access the API at the URL https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions using the model for which you hold a license. For example, I have a license for gpt-4o. 
The next steps involve establishing a connection and making a POST API call to enjoy the ChatGPT application experience.
